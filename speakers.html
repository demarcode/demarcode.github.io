However, it turns out that you don’t have to be a math genius to learn to code! With a few learning hacks, you can actually sculpt your brain, develop a mind for computational thinking and numbers, and unlock your potential — even if you failed algebra!</p>

This is a shortage of a million people. Sure enough, the tech industry is encouraging more people to get into tech by having vibrant communities such as women techmakers,  google developers group, moms can code etc.</p>

                    <p class="dark text-left">But what about the next generation? And the generation after that? Today’s generation of young people are very immersed with technology, it surely had become an essential part of their daily lives But, we must keep in mind that, it is an equally important skill not only to use technology, but how to create them. And so with this, we could encourage kids to harness the full potential of today’s technology by creating them: how to spark curiosity and interest for technology making to kids and the youth, and introduce them to skills like problem solving and critical thinking which are vital life skills.</p>

I’ll start by sharing an outlining method that can organize and structure your thoughts. From there she’ll talk about the writing process itself and some tips on how to stay focused as you write. Following that, Sue tell viewers about some useful tools to create screen captures, graphics, and other images along with linking to code snippets that can enhance your tutorial for your readers. The session will end with some ideas about the importance of having a technical editor review the work before publishing. By following this suggested workflow, attendees will discover how to straightforwardly author and rapidly deploy authentic and easy to follow coding tutorials.

                    <p class="dark text-left" >As a recovering perfectionist, one of the best lessons I hope to share is that it's good to fail. Failure means trying things outside of your abilities and comfort zone, it also means an opportunity to learn and grow.</p>

                    <p class="dark text-left">As a young mom, I worry about comparing myself with other mothers who have it together better than I do. At the same time, I worry about the keeping up with my peers in the technology sector. I won't be able to do a good job at either without stretching myself.</p>

                    <p class="dark text-left">As a parent and as a professional, giving yourself the freedom to fail is the best way to succeed.

                    <p class="dark text-left" >Imagine a road trip to your favorite destination. Maybe it’s a beach, or the mountains, or maybe it’s your mama’s house. You head off on your journey and run into a road block, so you take the detour. Along this detour a sign for a neat little pit stop catches your eye and it’s just a few miles out of the way so you add that to your adventure and reroute your trip. You still make it to your destination, but the trip didn’t look quite like you imagined it when you first excitedly set out on your originally chosen path. I believe this is very similar to what lifelong learning looks like. We have an idea of what we want to achieve or where we want to go, but along the way we may be frustrated by a roadblock that reroutes us. We may even run across something that we find so much interest in we completely change our destination. Growth changes us and adaptability is crucial so that the roadblocks in our journey don’t leave us stranded on the side of the road. There is no right or wrong path to take on your quest of life-long learning, the important thing is just that you travel it. </p>
