            According to the Code Stars short film by Code.org, over the next ten years, there will be 1.4  million jobs in computer science, and only about 400,000 grads are qualified for those jobs. This is a shortage of a million people. Sure enough, the tech industry is encouraging more people to get into tech by having vibrant communities such as women techmakers,  google developers group, moms can code etc.

            But what about the next generation? And the generation after that? Today’s generation of young people are very immersed with technology, it surely had become an essential part of their daily lives But, we must keep in mind that, it is an equally important skill not only to use technology, but how to create them. And so with this, we could encourage kids to harness the full potential of today’s technology by creating them: how to spark curiosity and interest for technology making to kids and the youth, and introduce them to skills like problem solving and critical thinking which are vital life skills.

An email developer, is someone who designs, edits and codes emails for a company or organization.

Following that, I’ll tell viewers about some useful tools to create screen captures, graphics, and other images along with linking to code snippets that can enhance your tutorial for your readers. The session will end with some ideas about the importance of having a technical editor review the work before publishing.

      <div class="card-body">Development is failing over and over again at each step until you succeed, and learning how to do something just in time for everything to change. Continuous learning and growth is necessary to learn how to code, keep up with changes in technology, and step into new roles in leadership. Join me to look at the parallels between processes you may be learning or already familiar with in development and approaches to self-improvement proven to be successful in behavioral psychology. Attendees will learn how to improve goal focus with a sustainable pace and automate self-improvement using habits and environmental nudges.

      <div class="card-body">Imagine a road trip to your favorite destination. Maybe it’s a beach, or the mountains, or maybe it’s your mama’s house. You head off on your journey and run into a road block, so you take the detour. Along this detour, a sign for a neat little pit stop catches your eye and it’s just a few miles out of the way so you add that to your adventure and reroute your trip. You still make it to your destination, but the trip didn’t look quite like you imagined it when you first excitedly set out on your originally chosen path. I believe this is very similar to what lifelong learning looks like. We have an idea of what we want to achieve or where we want to go, but along the way we may be frustrated by a roadblock that reroutes us. We may even run across something that we find so much interest in we completely change our destination. Growth changes us and adaptability is crucial so that the roadblocks in our journey don’t leave us stranded on the side of the road. There is no right or wrong path to take on your quest of life-long learning, the important thing is just that you travel it.

      <div class="card-body">As a mom, I'm sure that you wonder how you can manage being a parent and being a successful as a student simultaneously.  Out-of-school learning is the perfect opportunity for us moms to get the skills that we need to move our careers forward, while still taking into account our family life.  This talk will cover how to be successful as an adult learner who is learning outside of the traditional classroom environment.  We'll discuss how to set your learning goal, scheduling strategy, discipline, success mindset, support systems, and self-care so that you can be both the mom and the student that you want to be.

      <div class="card-body">As a recovering perfectionist, one of the best lessons I hope to share is that it's good to fail. Failure means trying things outside of your abilities and comfort zone, it also means an opportunity to learn and grow.
      As a young mom, I worry about comparing myself with other mothers who have it together better than I do. At the same time, I worry about the keeping up with my peers in the technology sector. I won't be able to do a good job at either without stretching myself.
      As a parent and as a professional, giving yourself the freedom to fail is the best way to succeed.

This talk will be geared, specifically, towards how to encourage students to dream big and follow lofty goals after facing past academic struggles. Ashley will share her personal story of graduating with a mere 2.1 GPA from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign College of Business to graduating with a 3.86 GPA  from Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law, and how she used a growth mindset to do so. She will also explain some of the lesser discussed strategies parents can use to encourage students when they are exhibiting academic struggles. This talk will discuss what Ashley has coined the "show first, then tell" model of encouraging students to reach academic success.
